# AI Copilot (Bing AI)
- [Deploy on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/login?next=%2Fspaces%2Fngoctuanai%2Fgpt4%3Fduplicate%3Dtrue)

## Introduction
- ⭐ Based on Microsoft New Bing, the Microsoft New Bing website is custom-built with Vue3 and Go. It provides a consistent user interface experience, supports ChatGPT prompts, and is essentially compatible with all the features of Microsoft Bing AI. You can chat without needing to log in.

- ⭐ When using the official Bing chat server (recommended for speed and stability), you can refer to the following solutions:

- ⭐ Chat server (default is "Cool Server"). The number of requests is limited to 100,000 per day. It can be changed in Settings => Service Options in the upper right corner.

- ⭐ Available (deployment server connected directly to www.bing.com without CN redirection and can be configured for connection)

- ⭐ Supports open-source ChatGPT prompt vocabulary

- ⭐ When you need advanced features such as drawing, etc. (you need to give commands).

- ⭐ If you encounter any issues, first click on the lower left corner! Try refreshing if it doesn't work, (Shift + F5 or Ctrl + Shift + R or settings in the upper right corner and select clear cookies), and the last tip is to clear the browser cache and cookies, such as (24-hour limit, prompts not logged in, etc.)

- ⭐ Requires selecting the Creative Conversation mode
